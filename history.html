                <h1>JAPANESE CAR CULTURE HISTORY</h1>
                <img src="images/foto5.jpg" style="float:left;" class="imageHistory"/>
                <p>Although the JDM scene and culture cannot be traced back to a specific date, it was during the
                    1980s that Japanese manufacturers
                    began manufacturing incredible sports cars, like the Toyota AE86.
                    It was then that motorsports and a fascination with these cars began to spread like wildfire.
                    During the mid-’80s, groups and cultures were starting to take off in Japan, with the group
                    known as the Kanjozoku. The Kanjozoku were a group of people who raced exclusively with Honda Civics.
                    There was also the Yakuza, the famous Japanese mob, who began modifying their vehicles,
                    namely Toyota Crowns in a style now known today as the “VIP Style”.</p>
                <p>
                    While Japanese-made sports cars were taking off in Asia, the American market didn’t 
                    have access to these cars. American muscle cars and expensive European exotics made
                     up the majority of vehicles owned in this market.
                    As the ’80s came to a close and the ’90s began, Japanese used cars 
                    began entering the American market. These Japanese sports cars offered the 
                    perfect blend in what the American market loved about their domestic cars, as 
                    well as European exotics. Japanese vehicles offered the affordability and low 
                    price point of 
                    domestic American cars, along with performance stats that matched European cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The influence of these 90’s JDM cars is still felt in today’s age, with 
                    many of the mid-to-late 90’s cars holding up and even appreciating despite
                    their age. Vehicles such as the Toyota Chaser, Mazda RX-7, and Toyota Supra 
                    all hold legendary status in the JDM sphere.The Fast and Furious franchise starting
                    in the early 2000s is what really propelled JDM cars and culture into the spotlight.
                    From Brian’s famous Skyline GT-R in the first two installments of the franchise to 
                    Han’s RX-7 in the third, these films brought JDM cars into the mainstream media and
                    in the eyes of millions worldwide.It also paved the way for the boom in street
                    racing and meet-ups, which made modifying and tuning even more popular. The Need
                    for Speed games also gave way to the rise of interest in JDM cars to the younger
                    generations of the early 2000s. The popularity of these games spanned several 
                    years and featured cars including the Mitsubishi Eclipse and WRX. Again,
                    glimpses into the culture of car modifying and street racing further propelled 
                    the JDM scene into the spotlight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although these glimpses of the JDM scene pushed the culture forward and into
                    the mainstream, it gave way to a new style of modifications – “ricing”. The flashy cars and insane looks seen in the Fast and Furious series, as well as mainstream gaming, led to the desire to also have cars of this nature.
                    The “ricing” look consisted of adding extra weight to the vehicle in the form
                    of body panels and kits without any investment in the performance of the
                    vehicle. In other words, investing in the aesthetic look of the car rather than 
                    the performance.
